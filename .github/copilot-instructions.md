Execution Guidelines
- Track progress in the checklist and keep updates concise.
- Use the current directory as the root and avoid creating extra folders.
- Use placeholders only when noted; replace with real links when available.
- Keep communications short; summarize command results instead of full logs.
- When unsure about a feature, ask for clarification before adding it.
